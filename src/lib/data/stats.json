{"Afghanistan": {"history": "Ahmad\nShah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The\ncountry served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won\nindependence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in\ndemocracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet\nUnion invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime, touching\noff a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless\npressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series\nof subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a\nhardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's\ncivil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New\nYork City, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action\ntoppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn\nConference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that\nincluded the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004,\nand National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became\nthe first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National\nAssembly was inaugurated the following December.

Algeria's primary political party, the\nNational Liberation Front (FLN), has dominated politics ever since. Many\nAlgerians in the subsequent generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to\ncounter the FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round\nsuccess of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting\nspurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of\nelections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led\ngovernment from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that\nspurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. The government\nlater allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based\nparties, but did not appease the activists who progressively widened their\nattacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense fighting\nbetween 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to\nindiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the\nupper hand by the late-1990s and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army,\ndisbanded in January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in\nconfronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional attacks on\nvillages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the presidency in 1999 in a\nfraudulent election but claimed neutrality in his 2004 landslide reelection\nvictory. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term,\nincluding the ethnic minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale\nunemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies,\ngovernment inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of\nextremist militants. The 2006 merger of the Salafist Group for Preaching and\nCombat (GSPC) with al-Qaida (followed by a name change to al-Qaida in the Lands\nof the Islamic Maghreb) signaled an increase in bombings, including\nhigh-profile, mass-casualty suicide attacks targeted against the Algerian\ngovernment and Western interests. Algeria must also diversify its\npetroleum-based economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has\nnot been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure problems.\nBOUTEFLIKA was overwhelmingly reelected to a third term in 2009 after the\ngovernment amended the constitution in 2008 to remove presidential term limits.\nLongstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA, including large-scale\nunemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies,\ngovernment inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of\nextremist militants.", "Location": "Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia", "Coordinates": "28 00 N, 3 00 E", "Map references": "Africa", "Area": "total: 2,381,740 sq km water: 0 sq km land: 2,381,740 sq km", "Area comparative": "slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas", "Land boundaries": "total: 6,343 km border countries: Libya 982 km, Mali 1,376 km, Mauritania 463 km, Morocco 1,559 km, Niger 956 km, Tunisia 965 km, Western Sahara 42 km", "Coastline": "998 km", "Maritime claims": "territorial sea: 12 NM exclusive fishing zone: 32-52 NM", "Climate": "arid to semiarid;

The king placed the\ncountry under French protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina\nin 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full\nindependence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle,\nCommunist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and\ntowns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or\nstarvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978\nVietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year\nVietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991\nParis Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not\nfully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped\nrestore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional\nfighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of\nnational elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government\nand renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge\nsurrendered in early 1999. Some of the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders are\nawaiting trial by a UN-sponsored tribunal for crimes against humanity. Elections\nin July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations\nbetween contending political parties before a coalition government was formed.\nIn October 2004, King SIHANOUK abdicated the throne due to illness and his son,\nPrince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him.

Spanish rule, marked initially by neglect, became\nincreasingly repressive, provoking an independence movement and occasional\nrebellions that were harshly suppressed. It was US intervention during the\nSpanish-American War in 1898 that finally overthrew Spanish rule. The subsequent\nTreaty of Paris established Cuban independence, which was granted in 1902 after\na three-year transition period.

A unified kingdom arose\ncirca 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three\nmillennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn\nwere replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who\nintroduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for\nthe next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about\n1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in\n1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an\nimportant world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly\nto protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in\n1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914.\nPartially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with\nthe overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the\nAswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the\ntime-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A\nrapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land,\nand dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society.\nThe government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population\nthrough economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical\ninfrastructure.", "Location": "Northern Africa, bordering         the Mediterranean Sea, between Libya and the Gaza Strip, and the Red Sea         north of Sudan, and includes the Asian Sinai Peninsula", "Coordinates": "27 00 N, 30 00 E", "Area": "total: 1,001,450 sq         km       land: 995,450 sq km       water: 6,000 sq km", "Area comparative": "slightly more than three         times the size of New Mexico", "Land boundaries": "total: 2,665 km       border countries: Gaza Strip 11 km, Israel 266 km, Libya 1,115         km, Sudan 1,273 km", "Coastline": "2,450 km", "Maritime claims": "contiguous zone: 24         NM       territorial sea: 12 NM       continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation       exclusive economic zone: 200 NM", "Climate": "desert;

Iran has been\ndesignated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon and\nelsewhere in the world and remains subject to US and UN economic sanctions and\nexport controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and\nconventional weapons proliferation. Following the election of reformer Hojjat\nol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and similarly a reformer Majles\n(parliament) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to\npopular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative\npoliticians, through the control of unelected institutions, prevented reform\nmeasures from being enacted and increased repressive measures. Starting with\nnationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections\nin 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected government\ninstitutions, which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner\nMahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. In December 2006 and March 2007, the\ninternational community passed resolutions 1737 and 1747 respectively after Iran\nfailed to comply with UN demands to halt the enrichment of uranium or to agree\nto full IAEA oversight of its nuclear program.

in 1920, it was declared a League of Nations mandate under UK\nadministration. In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its\nindependence as a kingdom in 1932. A \"republic\" was proclaimed in\n1958, but in actuality a series of military strongmen ruled the country until\n2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an\ninconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized\nKuwait but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of\nJanuary-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council\n(UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range\nmissiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance\nwith UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of\nIraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. Coalition forces\nremain in Iraq under a UNSC mandate, helping to provide security and to support\nthe freely elected government. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which\ntemporarily administered Iraq after the invasion, transferred full governmental\nauthority on 28 June 2004 to the Iraqi Interim Government, which governed under\nthe Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL, elections for\na 275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held in Iraq on 30\nJanuary 2005. Following these elections, the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG)\nassumed office. The TNA was charged with drafting Iraq's permanent constitution,\nwhich was approved in a 15 October 2005 constitutional referendum. An election\nunder the constitution for a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) was\nheld on 15 December 2005. The CoR approval in the selection of most of the\ncabinet ministers on 20 May 2006 marked the transition from the ITG to Iraq's\nfirst constitutional government in nearly a half-century.", "Location": "Middle East, bordering the         Persian Gulf, between Iran and Kuwait", "Coordinates": "33 00 N, 44 00 E", "Area": "total: 437,072 sq km       water: 4,910 sq km       land: 432,162 sq km", "Area comparative": "slightly more than twice         the size of Idaho", "Land boundaries": "total: 3,650 km       border countries: Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 240 km,         Saudi Arabia 814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 352 km", "Coastline": "58 km", "Maritime claims": "continental shelf:         not specified       territorial sea: 12 NM", "Climate": "mostly desert;

Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and\nachieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations\nin the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAYEV, who had\nrun the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were\nwon overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. The political\nopposition organized demonstrations in Bishkek in April, May, and November 2006\nresulting in the adoption of a new constitution that transferred some of the\npresident's powers to parliament and the government. In December 2006, the\nKyrgyz parliament voted to adopt new amendments, restoring some of the\npresidential powers lost in the November 2006 constitutional change. By\nlate-September 2007, both previous versions of the constitution were declared\nillegal, and the country reverted to the AKAYEV-era 2003 constitution, which was\nsubsequently modified in a flawed referendum initiated by BAKIEV. The president\nthen dissolved parliament, called for early elections, and gained control of the\nnew parliament through his newly-created political party, Ak Jol, in December\n2007 elections.

France granted this area independence in 1943. A lengthy civil\nwar (1975-1990) devastated the country, but Lebanon has since made progress\ntoward rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the\nblueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a more\nequitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater voice in\nthe political process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the\ngovernment. Since the end of the war, Lebanon has conducted several successful\nelections. Most militias have been disbanded, and the Lebanese Armed Forces\n(LAF) have extended authority over about two-thirds of the country. Hizballah, a\nradical Shia organization listed by the US State Department as a Foreign\nTerrorist Organization, retains its weapons. During Lebanon's civil war, the\nArab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's troop deployment, numbering\nabout 16,000 based mainly east of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley. Israel's\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 and the passage in October 2004 of\nUNSCR 1559 - a resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its\ninterference in Lebanese affairs - encouraged some Lebanese groups to demand\nthat Syria withdraw its forces as well. The assassination of former Prime\nMinister Rafiq HARIRI and 20 others in February 2005 led to massive\ndemonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence (\"the Cedar\nRevolution\"), and Syria withdrew the remainder of its military forces in\nApril 2005. In May-June 2005, Lebanon held its first legislative elections since\nthe end of the civil war free of foreign interference, handing a majority to the\nbloc led by Saad HARIRI, the slain prime minister's son. Lebanon continues to be\nplagued by violence - Hizballah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in July 2006\nleading to a 34-day conflict with Israel. The LAF in May-September 2007 battled\nSunni extremist group Fatah al-Islam in the Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee\ncamp; and the country has witnessed a string of politically motivated\nassassinations since the death of Rafiq HARIRI. Lebanese politicians in November\n2007 were unable to agree on a successor to Emile LAHUD when he stepped down as\npresident, creating a political vacuum until the election of Army Commander\nMichel SULAYMAN in May 2008 and the formation of a new cabinet in July 2008.", "Location": "Middle East, bordering the         Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and Syria", "Coordinates": "33 50 N, 35 50 E", "Area": "total: 10,400 sq km       water: 170 sq km       land: 10,230 sq km", "Area comparative": "about 0.7 times the size of         Connecticut", "Land boundaries": "total: 454 km       border countries: Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km", "Coastline": "225 km", "Maritime claims": "territorial sea: 12         NM", "Climate": "Mediterranean;

The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries;\nthe British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The separation in\n1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East\nsections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India\nand Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir\nterritory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India\ncapitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics -\nresulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. In\nresponse to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in\n1998. The dispute over the state of Kashmir is ongoing, but discussions and\nconfidence-building measures have led to decreased tensions since 2002. Mounting\npublic dissatisfaction with President MUSHARRAF, coupled with the assassination\nof the prominent and popular political leader, Benazir BHUTTO, in late 2007, and\nMUSHARRAF's resignation in August 2008, led to the September presidential\nelection of Asif ZARDARI, BHUTTO's widower.

they were\nceded to the US in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. In 1935 the\nPhilippines became a self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected\npresident and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a\n10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese occupation during\nWorld War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought together during 1944-45 to\nregain control. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines attained its\nindependence. The 20-year rule of Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a\n\"people power\" movement in Manila (\"EDSA 1\") forced him into\nexile and installed Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by\nseveral coup attempts, which prevented a return to full political stability and\neconomic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992 and his\nadministration was marked by greater stability and progress on economic reforms.\nIn 1992, the US closed its last military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA\nwas elected president in 1998, but was succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria\nMACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on\ncorruption charges broke down and another \"people power\" movement\n(\"EDSA 2\") demanded his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a\nsix-year term as president in May 2004. The Philippine Government faces threats\nfrom three terrorist groups on the US Government's Foreign Terrorist\nOrganization list, but in 2006 and 2007 scored some major successes in capturing\nor killing key wanted terrorists.

Various paramilitary bands resisted Nazi Germany's\noccupation and division of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945, but fought each other\nand ethnic opponents as much as the invaders. The military and political\nmovement headed by Josip TITO (Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when\nGerman and Croatian separatist forces were defeated in 1945. Although Communist,\nTITO's new government and his successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer\ntheir own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four\nand a half decades. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Serbian\nRepublic and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian domination led to the\nviolent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia,\nand Macedonia declared independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining\nrepublics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia led various\nmilitary campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a\n\"Greater Serbia.\" These actions led to Yugoslavia being ousted from\nthe UN in 1992, but Serbia continued its - ultimately unsuccessful - campaign\nuntil signing the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC kept tight control\nover Serbia and eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998, an\nethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo\nprovoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and\nmassive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC\ngovernment's rejection of a proposed international settlement led to NATO's\nbombing of Serbia in the spring of 1999 and to the eventual withdrawal of\nSerbian military and police forces from Kosovo in June 1999. UNSC Resolution\n1244 in June 1999 authorized the stationing of a NATO-led force (KFOR) in Kosovo\nto provide a safe and secure environment for the region's ethnic communities,\ncreated a UN interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to foster\nself-governing institutions, and reserved the issue of Kosovo's final status for\nan unspecified date in the future. In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a constitutional\nframework that allowed Kosovo to establish institutions of self-government and\nled to Kosovo's first parliamentary election. FRY elections in September 2000\nled to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and installed Vojislav KOSTUNICA as president. A\nbroad coalition of democratic reformist parties known as DOS (the Democratic\nOpposition of Serbia) was subsequently elected to parliament in December 2000\nand took control of the government. DOS arrested MILOSEVIC in 2001 and allowed\nfor him to be tried in The Hague for crimes against humanity. (MILOSEVIC died in\nMarch 2006 before the completion of his trial.) In 2001, the country's\nsuspension from the UN was lifted. In 2003, the FRY became Serbia and\nMontenegro, a loose federation of the two republics with a federal level\nparliament. Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo\nin March 2004 caused the international community to open negotiations on the\nfuture status of Kosovo in January 2006. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its\nright to secede from the federation and - following a successful referendum - it\ndeclared itself an independent nation on 3 June 2006. Two days later, Serbia\ndeclared that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro.\nA new Serbian constitution was approved in October 2006 and adopted the\nfollowing month.

After a\nperiod of one-party rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the\n1950 election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful\ntransfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have multiplied, but\ndemocracy has been fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military\ncoups (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually resulted in a return of\npolitical power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the\nouster - popularly dubbed a \"post-modern coup\" - of the then\nIslamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to\nprevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to\nthe \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,\" which only Turkey\nrecognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan Workers'\nParty (PKK) - now known as the People's Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel\n(KGK) - has dominated the Turkish military's attention and claimed more than\n30,000 lives.
